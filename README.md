## Program A: *Simple Memory Manipulation*

### Description
Program A loads a value into an accumulator and stores the current value of the accumulator into an address.  This is repeated two more times.

*TARGET PROGRAM END:* 11

*Target met*

### Program
First, the program loads the value of *9*h into the accumulator.  From there, the program stores the current value of the accumulator (*9*h) into a label, *m1*.  *m1* points to the address *B0*.  The program then loads the value of *8*h into the accumulator, then stores that value (*8*h) into a new label, *m2*, which points to the address *C4*.  The same process is repeated for the value of *B*h, which is stored into the address, *CB*.  At the end, the program is put into an infinite loop to prevent the program from crashing.



## Program B: *Mathematics*

### Description
Program B retrieves a value from location *B0*, doubles that value, then subtracts that value by 4.  The result is then output to *Port 2*.  

*TARGET PROGRAM END:* 0C

*Target met*

### Program
The program begins by first loading the value of -4 into the accumulator, where -4 is equal to *C*h.  Next, the value within address *B0* is added twice to the accumulator.  Finally, the value in the accumulator is output to *Port 2*.  *NOTE:* a positive test value should be in the location of *B0*.  This program also ends with an infinite loop. 


## Program C: *Loops*

### Description
Program C reads the value from *Input Port 3*, then displays that value on *Output Port 0*.  *Port 1* displays 1 less of the value from *Port 0*.  *Port 2* displays 1 less of the value from *Port 1*.  From here, *Port 0* will decrement by 1.  Effectively, *Port 1* will decrement so as to be 1 less than the value in *Port 0*, and *Port 2* will also decrement so as to be 1 less than the value in *Port 1*.  Each port will continue to decrement accordingly in an infinite loop.

*TARGET PROGRAM END:* 10

*Target met*

### Program
The program first reads the value from *Input Port 3* and loads that value into the accumulator.  That value is then output into *Port 0*.  The accumulator is then decremented by 1.  The program accomplishes this by adding *F*h (-1) to the accumulator.  This current value in the accumulator is then output into *Port 1*.  Again, the accumulator decrements by 1, and then outputs the value into *Port 2*.  From here, the accumulator increments by 1, and the program loops back to outputting the current accumulator value into *Port 0*.  The program will infinitely loop through and decrement each port.


## Extra Credit:
Each program matched the target end address for a total of 3 bonus points!
* Program A ends at address 11
* Program B ends at address 0C
* Program C ends at address 10
